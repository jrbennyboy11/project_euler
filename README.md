This repository contains my code for solving problems on projecteuler.net. Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help one arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

I enjoy doing these problems for fun, as they challenge both my problem solving and programming abilities. I started out doing these problems in C and C++, but have more recently been doing them in Ruby since it's quicker to write and some of the later problems require larger than 64 bit numbers. 

Please note that some of the problems may have been modified since I solved them.
