> Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.

This repository contains my personal code for solving problems on projecteuler.net. I enjoy doing these problems for fun, as they challenge both my problem solving and programming abilities. I started out doing these problems in C and C++, but have more recently been doing them in Ruby since it's quicker to write and some of the later problems require larger than 64 bit numbers. 

Please note that some of the problems may have been modified since I solved them.
